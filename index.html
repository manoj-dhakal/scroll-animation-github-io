  <h1>Poem:</h1>
  <h2>A poem to my younger self</h2>

<pre class = "poem">

  Any day,
  It is easy to feel disappointed
  Be overwhelmed,
  Carry the guilt you never had to,
  Fondle your mind with the senseless of experience,

  But is it not all distractions?
  Pretensions?

  Can you pretend to be happy?
  Can you pretend to have hope?

  But the crevices of your brain that has been exhausted with all the questions,
  They see all the people, don’t they?
  What people do, to rationalize
  What they do
  And you still want to hide.
  Because you believe you are the same.

  Any day,
  It is easy to fall into the chasm of hopelessness,
  But why do we even need hope,
  When all there is is pretension?
  All I want for you is to be not disappointed in yourself,
  But I know you can’t,
  We never can.
  Because

  The pretension is too strong.
  The hope is too bold.
  The guilt scathe-s too deep.

  Neither I have answers,
  Nor are the questions right.
  But everyday is not any day,
  Please gather every ounce of moment,
  That sparkles of happiness,
  Until the pretension is no more,
  And you don’t have to
  Beg for happiness,
  Every hour every day
  With what you call yourself.

  -Me
